description: Scheduled dependency-health sweep — outdated packages (behind on patch/minor/major), deprecated or end-of-life packages, unused declared dependencies, phantom (used-but-undeclared) dependencies, lockfile drift, and license issues. Routes one focused PR for mechanically-safe fixes (a batched routine-bump PR, an unused-dep removal) and an issue for anything needing a decision (a major bump, a deprecated package needing a replacement, a license-policy violation) — deliberately capped. Honest about coverage: a category whose analyzer isn't installed is reported "not scanned", never clean. Distinct from `audit-security`, which owns vulnerabilities/CVEs; this is the non-security health side. Reads the repo config for language + pre-flight commands. Use when the user asks to "audit dependencies", "check for outdated/deprecated packages", "find unused dependencies", "check the lockfile", "review licenses", or when invoked by a scheduled remote agent. Has working-tree side effects (branches + PRs) and GitHub side effects (issues, labels).

# Audit dependency health and file discrete units of work

This skill is a recurring sweep of the repo's **dependency health** — the non-security side of
dependencies. It finds packages drifting out of date, going deprecated, sitting unused, missing from
the manifest, drifting out of lockfile sync, or carrying a license the project shouldn't ship. It
**fixes what is mechanically safe** (one focused PR) and **files an issue** for anything that needs a
decision (a breaking major bump, a deprecated package needing a replacement, a license violation).

It shares the audits-family discipline: **deliberately conservative**, capped per run, dedups against
open work. It has one deliberate exception to "one finding per PR" — see
[Routine bumps batch into one PR](#routing-and-the-batch-pr-exception).

## Load the repo config

Read `.claude/maintainerd.json` (see
[`../../../core/reference/config-schema.md`](../../../core/reference/config-schema.md)); if missing,
stop and tell the user to run `/bootstrap`.

Keys this skill uses:
- `config.repo` — GitHub `owner/name` for every `gh ... --repo`.
- `config.defaultBranch` — branch to check out and target PRs at.
- `config.language` — `python` | `typescript`; selects the ecosystem tooling below.
- `config.commands.{test,build,lint,format}` — **the gate every dependency change must pass** before
  a PR (a bump that breaks the build is worse than being behind). Skip any that are `null`.
- `config.labels.dependencies` — label applied to every PR/issue this skill opens (default
  `dependencies`).
- `config.labels.automated` — also applied (default `automated`).
- `config.audits.depsPrCap` / `config.audits.depsIssueCap` — per-run caps (default **3 / 5**).
- `config.guidelines.*` — if the repo documents a **dependency or license policy** (an allowed-license
  allowlist, a "pin exactly / never auto-bump X" rule, a "stay on major N of Y" constraint), honor
  it. Absent a policy, apply the sensible defaults below and note in the report that no policy was found.

Treat a `null` command as "this repo has no such step — skip it."

## What it looks for

| Category | Detection | Default routing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Outdated — patch/minor** | The ecosystem's "outdated" report (see language blocks). | **PR**, batched — see below. Each bump must keep `config.commands.*` green. |
| **Outdated — major** | Same report; flag entries where only a new **major** is available. | **Issue** — a major bump is a breaking-change review, one issue per package (or an umbrella if many). |
| **Deprecated / EOL** | Registry deprecation flags; packages whose maintainers marked them deprecated or that are past end-of-life. | **Issue** — choosing a replacement is a decision. **Prioritize these**: a deprecated dep stops getting fixes. |
| **Unused (declared, not imported)** | Dependency-analysis tool (depcheck/knip; deptry). **Triage every hit** — build-only tools, plugins loaded by config, and type-only packages commonly false-positive. | **PR** — removal is mechanical and reversible, but only after confirming it's truly unreferenced. |
| **Phantom (imported, not declared)** | Same tool — modules imported but not in the manifest (relying on a transitive dep). | **PR** to add it explicitly, **or issue** if the right version/source is unclear. |
| **Lockfile drift** | Manifest and lockfile out of sync, or the lockfile isn't committed / doesn't install cleanly. | **PR** to regenerate the lockfile — **or**, if CI should have caught it, flag the CI gap in the report instead of silently papering over it. |
| **License issues** | License-listing tool; flag licenses outside the repo's policy (or `UNKNOWN`/changed-since-last-run). | **Issue** — a license call is policy/legal, not a code fix. |

### Language-specific tooling

Run the block matching `config.language`. Prefer tools that need no install; escalate to analyzers
only if present. If neither language matches, do what the lockfile/manifest allows and **say so**.

**Python** (`config.language == "python"`):
- Outdated: `uv pip list --outdated` / `pip list --outdated --format=json`.
- Deprecated/EOL: registry metadata; cross-check well-known EOL packages.
- Unused/phantom: `deptry <source>` if present.
- Lockfile: `uv lock --check` (or verify `uv.lock`/`poetry.lock` matches `pyproject.toml`).
- Licenses: `pip-licenses --format=json` if present.

**TypeScript / JavaScript** (`config.language == "typescript"`):
- Outdated: `npm outdated --json` (built in, no install).
- Deprecated: `npm` surfaces deprecation warnings on install/ls; `npm ls` for the tree.
- Unused/phantom: `depcheck` or `knip` if present (knip also covers code; here use its deps view).
- Lockfile: `npm ci --dry-run` / confirm `package-lock.json` is in sync and committed.
- Licenses: `license-checker --json` if present.

## Distinct from `audit-security`

`audit-security` owns **vulnerabilities** — a dependency with a CVE/GHSA advisory is its finding, and
it may bump the dep to fix it. **This skill does not file security findings.** If you notice a
vulnerable package here, leave it to `audit-security` (don't double-file); this skill's "outdated" is
about *staying current*, not *patching a known hole*. The two dedup against each other by label and
branch prefix.

## What it does NOT do

- **No CVEs / vulnerabilities** — that's `audit-security`.
- **No blind "bump everything to latest".** Major bumps are breaking-change reviews (issues), and a
  bump that fails the gate is dropped, not forced.
- **Doesn't re-file what CI gates.** If the repo already runs an outdated/license check in CI and it's
  red, that's a CI failure — flag the gap, don't duplicate.

## Workflow

Use `TaskCreate` to track each finding.

### 1. Pre-flight: start clean

```bash
git status --short                         # clean (except untracked config.paths.skillsDir scaffolding)
git checkout <config.defaultBranch> && git pull
```

Dirty tree outside `config.paths.skillsDir` → stop and report.

### 2. Detect available tooling — record what's missing

Probe the analyzers up front and **carry the result into the report**:

```bash
# TS: for t in depcheck knip license-checker; ...    Python: for t in deptry pip-licenses; ...
```

`outdated` and lockfile checks are built into the package managers (no install). For unused/phantom
and licenses, if the analyzer is missing, mark that category **"not scanned"** — never silently clean.

### 3. Sweep the categories

Run each detection. **Collect findings before opening anything** so you can batch and dedup. For each,
note the package, current → available version, and the reason (outdated/deprecated/unused/etc.).

### 4. Dedup against existing work

```bash
gh issue list --repo <config.repo> --state open --label <config.labels.dependencies> --json number,title --limit 100
gh pr list   --repo <config.repo> --state open --json number,title,headRefName --limit 50
```

Skip a finding already covered by an open PR/issue, a Dependabot/Renovate PR (don't compete with the
repo's existing bot), or a `wontfix`/not-planned close (a standing decision — e.g. "we pin X").

### 5. Routing and the batch-PR exception

Process findings, deprecated/EOL first (they rot fastest), then phantom/unused, then routine bumps.

**Routine bumps batch into ONE PR.** Unlike the other audits, safe **patch + minor** updates group
into a single `deps-routine-bumps-<date>` PR (counts as one against `config.audits.depsPrCap`).
Reviewing fifteen homogeneous version bumps together is easier than fifteen PRs, and it mirrors how
Dependabot grouping works. Rules for the batch:
- Only patch/minor for deps whose changelog shows no breaking change; **`config.commands.*` must stay
  green** with the whole batch applied. If the batch fails, bisect: drop the offending bump to its own
  issue and keep the rest.
- The PR body lists each `pkg X→Y` with the bump level.

Everything else is its **own** unit of work:
- **Major bump** → issue (breaking-change review), or a standalone PR only if you've confirmed it's
  genuinely non-breaking for this repo and the gate passes.
- **Deprecated/EOL** → issue naming the deprecation and a candidate replacement.
- **Unused dep** → PR removing it (after triage), or fold several confirmed-unused into one removal PR.
- **Phantom dep** → PR adding it (or issue if the version is unclear).
- **Lockfile drift** → PR regenerating the lockfile.
- **License violation** → issue (policy decision).

For every PR: branch `deps-<category>-<descriptor>` off `config.defaultBranch`, **delegate to
`create-pr` if installed** (else run `config.commands.*` as pre-flight; no `--no-verify`), label
`config.labels.dependencies` + `config.labels.automated`, never auto-merge. Caps default **3 PRs /
5 issues**; defer overflow to the next run and note it in the report.

### 6. Report

```text
Dependency audit — <YYYY-MM-DD>   (repo: <config.repo>, language: <config.language>)

Coverage: outdated ✓ · lockfile ✓ · unused via <tool/NOT SCANNED> · licenses via <tool/NOT SCANNED>

Findings: <total>
  PRs:    #NNN deps-routine-bumps-<date> — 6 patch/minor bumps (tests green)
          #NNN deps-unused-remove — drop 2 unreferenced devDeps
  Issues: #NNN major bump: <pkg> 3→4 (breaking — review)
          #NNN deprecated: <pkg> (EOL; candidate replacement: <pkg2>)
  Deferred (over cap): <...>

No findings in: <clean categories>     Not scanned: <categories with no analyzer>
```

If zero findings **and** every category was scanned: `Findings: 0 — dependencies healthy (all
categories scanned).` If anything couldn't be scanned, the report must say so — a partial sweep is
never a clean bill of health.

## What not to do

- **Don't report a category clean when its analyzer was missing.** "Not scanned" is the honest status.
- **Don't file security findings here** — leave CVEs to `audit-security`.
- **Don't force a bump that fails the gate**, and don't batch a major/breaking bump into the routine PR.
- **Don't remove a "unused" dependency without triaging it** — build tools, config-loaded plugins, and
  type-only packages false-positive constantly. Confirm it's truly unreferenced first.
- **Don't compete with Dependabot/Renovate** — if the repo runs one, dedup against its open PRs and
  focus on what it doesn't cover (unused, phantom, deprecated, licenses).
- **Don't operate on a dirty tree, skip pre-flight, `--no-verify`, or auto-merge.**

## When integrated with scheduling

Like the other audits, **not** part of `daily-update`. Schedule it its own slot via the `schedule`
skill, invoking it directly. Pairs with `audit-security` (vulnerabilities — the security side of the
same dependency set) and the code audits; each dedups against its own label/branch prefix.
