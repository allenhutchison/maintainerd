description: Weekly scan of arXiv for papers relevant to the work in this repo — derive themes from the repo, query arXiv, curate the few most relevant papers, write a dated digest, and open a PR. Use when the user asks to "run the research radar", "scan arxiv", "find recent papers relevant to <repo>", "what should we read this week", or when invoked by the weekly scheduled remote agent.

# Research radar

This skill produces a weekly, curated digest of recent arXiv papers relevant to what *this repo* is
actually building, and ships it as a dated file under `config.paths.researchRadarDir`
(`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) in a PR. Where the changelog skills record what *shipped*, this one records what's
worth *reading*.

Two things make it work, and both are leaned on hard:

1. **The repo defines "our work."** Because this runs inside the repo with `git`/`gh`, it doesn't
   need a hand-maintained interest profile — it derives current themes from recent PRs, active
   planning docs, and the source (or uses an explicit theme list from config). The filter is the
   entire value of the skill; a generic "AI papers this week" digest is worthless.
2. **The committed reports are the dedup memory.** Every run leaves a file in
   `config.paths.researchRadarDir`. Each run reads the recent ones and skips papers already
   surfaced, so a paper appears at most once even as it lingers near the top of arXiv for weeks.

Audience: the people building this repo. Every paper earns its place with a concrete "why this
matters to *us*" — a subsystem it informs, a problem we're fighting, an open issue it speaks to. Not
"this is an interesting paper about agents."

## Load the repo config

Before anything else, load the repo config (see
[`../../../core/reference/config-schema.md`](../../../core/reference/config-schema.md)):

1. Read `.claude/agent-skills.json` from the repo root.
2. If it does not exist, **STOP** and tell the user:
   > This repo has no `.claude/agent-skills.json`. Run `/bootstrap` to generate it, then re-run me.

   Do not guess values or hardcode another repo's settings.
3. Read the keys this skill needs:
   - `config.repo` — GitHub `owner/name`, passed to every `gh ... --repo`.
   - `config.defaultBranch` — the branch the PR targets (`main`, `master`, …) and that the repo is
     PR-only against.
   - `config.paths.researchRadarDir` — where this skill writes `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. If absent, fall back
     to `planning/research-radar/` and note the fallback in your report.
   - `config.researchRadar.themes` — `"derive"` (infer from the repo) or an explicit string array.
     If the whole `researchRadar` section is absent, default to `"derive"` and note it.
   - `config.researchRadar.userAgent` — the courtesy User-Agent for the arXiv API. If absent, fall
     back to `research-radar/1.0 (mailto:maintainer@example.com)` and note that the user should set a
     real contact.
   - For theme derivation: `config.paths.designDocs` and `config.paths.productDocs` (doc roots) and
     `config.paths.source` (source root).

## Themes (the query spine)

The set of research themes is the stable spine of the search. It comes from
`config.researchRadar.themes`:

- **Explicit array** — use those themes verbatim as the spine. Still sharpen them with fresh repo
  signal each run (step 1), but don't invent themes outside the list.
- **`"derive"`** — infer the themes from the repo itself (step 1). Build the spine from what the repo
  is actually working on: recent merged PRs, the design/product docs, and the source. Do not assume a
  domain — let the repo's own signal define the interest profile.

arXiv categories to scope to: pick the categories that match this repo's domain so the scan surfaces
signal without flooding. For an LLM-agent / AI codebase, the set that surfaced signal without
flooding in testing is `cs.AI`, `cs.CL`, `cs.HC`, `cs.MA`. `cs.LG` is a firehose of
training/architecture papers that mostly adds noise; add `cs.LG`, `cs.IR`, or `cs.SE` to a query only
when a week's repo signal is specifically about learning internals, retrieval, or coding agents.
Relevant work cross-listed from those categories already surfaces via the defaults. A repo in a
different domain should choose the arXiv categories that match its themes instead.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish "our work" — derive or refresh the themes

Pull recent signal so the scan tracks what we're working on *now*. If `config.researchRadar.themes`
is `"derive"`, this step *is* the theme source; if it's an explicit array, this step sharpens it.

```bash
# What shipped recently — the titles carry the live themes. Skim the last ~2 weeks.
gh pr list --repo <config.repo> --state merged --limit 50 --json number,title,mergedAt \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.mergedAt[:10]) #\(.number) \(.title)"'

# Which design docs are active (touched in the last few weeks). Run per config.paths.designDocs root.
git log --since="3 weeks ago" --name-only --pretty=format: -- <config.paths.designDocs> | sort -u | sed '/^$/d'
```

Also skim the source under `config.paths.source` and the docs under `config.paths.productDocs` (plus
a memory index like `MEMORY.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` if present) for ongoing project themes.
Fold anything notable — a new subsystem, a hard problem we're chewing on — into the keyword set for
step 2. Example: a week heavy on voice barge-in work → add `"endpointing"`, `"turn-taking"`,
`"full-duplex"` to the queries.

### 2. Query arXiv

Use the arXiv API (open, no key). Build one or a few `search_query`s combining the categories with
the keyword spine, sorted newest-first. URL-encode spaces as `+`, parens as `%28`/`%29`, and quote
phrases.

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/radar
UA="<config.researchRadar.userAgent>"
curl -sS -m 30 -A "$UA" 'https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%28cat:cs.AI+OR+cat:cs.CL+OR+cat:cs.HC+OR+cat:cs.MA%29+AND+%28abs:%22language+model+agent%22+OR+abs:%22tool+use%22+OR+abs:%22agent+memory%22+OR+abs:%22multi-agent%22%29&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=descending&max_results=150' \
  > /tmp/radar/q1.atom
```

(Swap the `cat:` set and the `abs:` keyword phrases for this repo's categories and theme spine — the
example above is an AI/agent profile.)

**`https://` and the `-A` User-Agent are both load-bearing** — arXiv returns an empty body for
plain-`http` or UA-less requests, which would silently look like a quiet week. Keep them. Run a
second query (`q2.atom`, …) for a different theme cluster if one query's keywords get unwieldy.
**Sleep ~3s between calls** — arXiv asks for ~1 request / 3 seconds; a weekly job is otherwise
trivially within budget.

Parse the Atom into a compact list and filter to the last 7 days by *submitted* date
(`<published>`). Filtering by submitted (not `<updated>`) is deliberate: it keeps v2/v3 revisions of
old papers from re-surfacing.

```bash
python3 - /tmp/radar/*.atom <<'PY'
import sys, json, re, datetime, xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
A, X = "{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}", "{http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom}"
cutoff = datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)
seen, out = set(), []
for path in sys.argv[1:]:
    for e in ET.parse(path).getroot().findall(f"{A}entry"):
        pub = (e.findtext(f"{A}published") or "")[:10]
        if not pub or datetime.date.fromisoformat(pub) < cutoff:
            continue
        url = (e.findtext(f"{A}id") or "").strip()
        base = re.sub(r"v\d+$", "", url)          # version-stripped id, for dedup
        if base in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(base)
        pc = e.find(f"{X}primary_category")
        out.append({
            "url": url,
            "title": " ".join((e.findtext(f"{A}title") or "").split()),
            "abstract": " ".join((e.findtext(f"{A}summary") or "").split()),
            "published": pub,
            "primary": pc.get("term") if pc is not None else "",
            "authors": [a.findtext(f"{A}name") for a in e.findall(f"{A}author")][:6],
        })
print(json.dumps(out, indent=2))
print(f"\n# {len(out)} papers in window", file=sys.stderr)
PY
```

If the newest query returned `max_results` entries and the oldest is still inside the window, you
truncated — raise `max_results` and re-fetch. If curl fails or returns zero `<entry>` elements (a
network/API problem, *distinct* from a genuinely quiet week), retry once after a few seconds; if it
still fails, **stop — do not open a PR** and report the failure (see "What not to do").

### 3. Curate and judge

This is the work. From the in-window list, select the **~5–8 papers most relevant to what we're
building** — the themes sharpened by step 1's signal. Read each candidate's abstract and ask: does
this inform a subsystem of this repo, a problem we're actively fighting, or an open issue? Rank by
*that*, not by general interest. A strong week might surface 10; a thin one, 2. Zero is possible but
rare — if so, see the quiet-week path in step 5.

### 4. Drop papers we've already surfaced

```bash
ls -1 <config.paths.researchRadarDir> 2>/dev/null | tail -8
```

Read the most recent several reports and collect the arXiv IDs they list. Drop any candidate whose
version-stripped ID already appears. The committed history is the dedup ledger — this is why every
run commits a file.

### 5. Write the report

Path: `config.paths.researchRadarDir`/`YYYY-MM-DD.md` (the run date). Create the directory if
missing. Template:

```markdown
# Research radar — <Month DD, YYYY>

**Window:** <YYYY-MM-DD> – <YYYY-MM-DD>  ·  **Surfaced:** <N> of <M> scanned
**Queried:** <categories queried this run, e.g. cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.HC, cs.MA>

---

## This week

<2–4 sentences: the through-line. What's most relevant to what we're building right now; call out any cluster ("three papers on agent memory this week"). If thin, say so plainly.>

## Papers

### [<Title>](<abs url>)
<first author et al.> · <primary category> · submitted <YYYY-MM-DD>

<1–3 sentences: what the paper does, then concretely why it matters to this repo — name the subsystem or open issue where the link is real. If the link is a stretch, move it to "Also noted" instead of overselling it.>

### ...

## Also noted

<Optional one-liners for borderline/adjacent papers not worth a full card — title link + half a sentence. Omit the section if empty.>
```

**Quiet-week path:** if step 3 genuinely found nothing relevant *and the fetch succeeded*, still
write the file with a one-line "This week" (e.g. "Quiet week — nothing in-window met the bar; scanned
<M>.") and an empty Papers section. The file keeps the cadence and the dedup ledger continuous, and
the PR is honest about being a no-content week.

### 6. Open the PR

The repo is PR-only — never push to `config.defaultBranch`.

**If `create-pr` is installed**, delegate the branch/commit/PR mechanics to it after writing the
file: it runs the repo's pre-flight gates and enforces the PR template. Tell it to branch from
`config.defaultBranch` with a `research-radar-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)` branch name and use the body
described below.

**Otherwise, open it inline:**

```bash
git checkout <config.defaultBranch> && git pull
git checkout -b research-radar-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)   # add -2, -3 if the branch already exists (cron double-fire)
git add <config.paths.researchRadarDir>
git commit -m "Research radar — $(date +%Y-%m-%d) (<N> papers)"
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --repo <config.repo> --base <config.defaultBranch> \
  --title "Research radar — $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" --body "<see below>"
```

PR body = the "This week" synthesis, then a bullet list of the surfaced papers as
`- [Title](url) — one-clause why`, so the digest is reviewable from the PR without opening the file.
Reply to the caller with the PR URL and a one-line shape ("6 papers, heavy on agent memory"). Don't
paste the whole report back.

## Voice and style

Match the repo's planning/doc voice — prose-forward, explains the *why*, no shouting.

- **No emojis. No marketing language.** State what a paper does and why it's relevant.
- **Link every paper to its arXiv abstract page**, always. The paper is the source of truth.
- **"Why it matters" is builder-facing and concrete.** Tie to a subsystem, a problem, or an issue
  number where the link is real. "Interesting work on agents" is not a reason.
- **Be honest about relevance.** A tangential paper goes under "Also noted" or gets cut. Don't pad
  the main list to hit a number.
- **Report only the abstract's claims.** You read abstracts, not full papers — frame accordingly
  ("the abstract reports…") and never assert results you didn't read.

## What not to do

- **Don't fabricate papers, authors, titles, or results.** Only report `<entry>` items the API
  actually returned. A hallucinated paper in a research digest is the worst possible failure here —
  when in doubt, drop it.
- **Don't open a PR when the fetch failed.** Distinguish a genuinely quiet week (fetch OK, nothing
  relevant) from a broken fetch (network/API error). The first writes a quiet-week file; the second
  stops and reports the error. Never label a failure as "quiet."
- **Don't re-surface papers from prior reports.** The dedup step is load-bearing; skipping it makes
  the digest repeat itself week over week.
- **Don't dump the scan.** 5–8 curated papers, not 150. The synthesis and selection *are* the
  deliverable.
- **Don't push to `config.defaultBranch`.** Branch + PR, every time.
- **Don't widen the window to pad a thin week.** Seven days, by submitted date. A quiet week is
  honest signal.
- **Don't reuse a branch from a prior run.** Same-day re-runs append a suffix.

## Scheduling

Runs in its own weekly `/schedule` slot (e.g. Monday morning). It is intentionally *not* folded into
`daily-update` — that bundles per-*day* skills, and this is weekly. If more weekly skills appear
later, mint a `weekly-update` meta-skill on the `daily-update` pattern and move this behind it.

## Related skills

- `bootstrap` — generates the `.claude/agent-skills.json` this skill reads.
- `create-pr` — opens the PR (runs the repo's gates, enforces the PR template) once the digest is
  written; this skill delegates step 6 to it when installed.
- `daily-update` — the per-*day* meta-skill; deliberately separate from this weekly job.
- `architecture-audit` — the other repo-derived scanner; it sweeps the code for tech debt where this
  one sweeps arXiv for reading.
