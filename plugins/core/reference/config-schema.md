# The repo config contract: `.claude/maintainerd.json`

Every Maintainerd skill is **repo-agnostic**. The repo-specific details — slug, branch,
language, paths, commands, label names, caps — live in a config file the consuming repo checks
in. This document is the canonical schema. The `bootstrap` skill generates the file; the other
skills read it.

There are two halves to the contract:

1. **`.claude/maintainerd.json`** — structured scalars (this document).
2. **`.claude/guidelines/*.md`** — free-form repo rules the skills read as prose (see
   [Guidelines files](#guidelines-files)).

---

## The "read your repo config" preamble

Every skill in this toolkit starts the same way. When a skill says *"load the repo config (see
config-schema.md)"*, it means exactly this:

1. Read `.claude/maintainerd.json` from the repo root.
2. If it does not exist, **stop** and tell the user:
   > This repo has no `.claude/maintainerd.json`. Run `/bootstrap` to generate it, then re-run me.
   Do not guess values or hardcode another repo's settings.
3. Read only the keys the skill needs. Treat a `null` command as *"this repo has no such step —
   skip it"* (e.g. a Python repo has `commands.build: null`; don't invent a build step).
4. For any key a skill needs that is **absent** (older config, optional section), fall back to the
   documented default below and mention the fallback in your run report so the user can add it.
5. When a skill needs repo-specific *rules* (coding standards, test conventions, invariants),
   read the markdown file named in `guidelines.*` rather than relying on built-in assumptions.

Read with whatever is convenient — the `Read` tool, or `jq` for a single value, e.g.
`jq -r '.defaultBranch' .claude/maintainerd.json`.

## Field reference

### Identity

| Key | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `repo` | GitHub `owner/name`; passed to every `gh --repo`. | `allenhutchison/pepper` |
| `defaultBranch` | Branch PRs target; audits `git checkout` it before sweeping. | `main`, `master` |
| `language` | Selects the language-specific detection rules in `audit-architecture` and `audit-tests`. | `python`, `typescript` |

### `commands`

Each value is a shell command or `null`. A skill that needs a step whose command is `null`
**skips that step** (and says so). Skills must never substitute a different repo's command.

| Key | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `format` | create-pr, audits | Non-mutating format check. |
| `lint` | create-pr, audits | May be `null` if the formatter also lints. |
| `build` | create-pr, auto-dev | `null` for interpreted languages with no build. |
| `test` | create-pr, audit-tests, auto-dev | The suite that gates PRs. |
| `coverage` | audit-tests | Optional; emits machine-readable coverage. |
| `typecheck` | create-pr, auto-dev | Optional separate type-check pass. |

### `paths`

All paths are repo-root-relative. `designDocs` and `productDocs` are **arrays** (a repo can have
several doc roots; entries may be directories or individual files). `skillsDir` names the directory
where untracked skill scaffolding may legitimately appear — the audits treat untracked files there
as benign rather than "a human is mid-work."

`prTemplate` may be `null`: the repo deliberately uses no PR template, and `create-pr` (and
anything else that writes PR bodies) falls back to its built-in Summary / Changes / Checklist
structure. A non-null value must point at a file that exists — bootstrap offers to scaffold one
when the repo has none, and `doctor` flags a dangling path.

### `guidelines`

Pointers to the markdown rule files. See [Guidelines files](#guidelines-files).

### `labels`, `audits`, `models`, `dailyUpdate`, `autoDev`, `researchRadar`, `review`, `release`

- `labels.*` — GitHub label names the skills apply. They must already exist in the repo (bootstrap
  offers to create them).
- `audits.*` — per-run caps, plus the two pattern-promotion knobs. Cap defaults `3/5`
  (architecture), `2/2` (test), `3/5` (security), and `3/5` (deps) if absent. `audit-security` still
  *reports* Critical/High findings that exceed its cap;
  `audit-deps` counts a batched routine-bump PR as a single PR. `promoteThreshold` (default `3`) and
  `promoteLookbackDays` (default `90`) govern **pattern promotion** — when the guideline-checking
  audits (architecture/tests/security) have fixed the same specific pattern `promoteThreshold` times
  within the window, they file one human-gated issue proposing it become a guideline rule; if a rule
  already exists and keeps being violated, they instead propose the corresponding **mechanical guard**
  (a lint/CI check). See
  [`../../audits/reference/pattern-promotion.md`](../../audits/reference/pattern-promotion.md).
- `models.*` *(optional)* — tier→model bindings. `fast` / `capable` (optionally a `mid` rung) map a
  tier to a concrete model id; **`default` is not a tier — it's the fallback key** used when a skill
  names no tier. Any of them set to `"inherit"` means no override. Declarative reference config: it
  records which concrete model backs each tier so scheduled routines are tiered consistently, and
  subagent-spawning skills can read it. Absent → every routine inherits its scheduled model
  (pre-tiering behavior). See [`model-tiers.md`](model-tiers.md) for which routine wants which tier.
- `dailyUpdate.subSkills` — the ordered roster `daily-update` runs. **Only list skills that are
  actually installed in this repo**, or `daily-update` will try to invoke a missing skill.
  `{date}` in `commitSubject` is replaced with the ISO date.
- `autoDev.*` — the `auto:*` state-machine label names, the bot comment `marker`, the branch
  prefix, the labels that exclude an issue from auto-building, and whether PRs open as drafts.
  `prLabel` *(default `auto:pr`)* is stamped on **every** PR the pipeline opens so external tooling
  (e.g. a CodeRabbit config) can single out automated PRs — it's deliberately separate from the
  generic `labels.automated` the audits share. `fallbackReviewMinutes` *(default `60`)* is how long
  a ready, CI-green automated PR may sit with no review activity before auto-dev posts a one-per-PR
  **fallback self-review** to fill the gap when CodeRabbit is rate-limited. `maxPrsInFlight`
  *(default `1`)* caps how many automated PRs may be open at once — `1` is the classic single-PR
  pipeline (an open PR blocks new builds until it merges); a higher cap lets the pipeline drain the
  Ready queue into several built-but-unmerged PRs awaiting review (it still never merges or closes
  anything). `orphanReclaimMinutes` *(default `90`)* is the minimum age of a PR-less in-progress
  issue before a tick treats it as a crashed build to rebuild, rather than one running concurrently
  in an overlapping tick (which it leaves alone) — the guard against two ticks racing on the same
  build. All optional; absent → the documented defaults.
- `researchRadar.themes` — `"derive"` to infer themes from the repo, or an explicit string array.
- `review.bots` *(optional)* — extra automated-reviewer logins `address-review` should recognize.
  Defaults to `["coderabbitai[bot]", "gemini-code-assist[bot]"]`. Humans are auto-detected (any
  reviewer who isn't the PR author), so only bots go here.
- `release.*` *(optional; `null`/omitted = no versioned releases — the repo ships continuously)* —
  the version-bump mechanism (`versionCommand` with `{level}`, `versionPushesTag`), the notes file
  to update (`notesFile`), an optional README section to sync (`readmeSection`), and whether to
  create a GitHub release (`githubRelease`). Repo-specific gates/caveats live in
  `guidelines.release`, not here.
- `journal.*` *(optional)* — maps this repo to its project in the user's Obsidian vault for
  `worklog`: `project` (folder name) and/or `hubNote` (explicit vault-relative path). Absent → the
  project is inferred from the repo name. The **vault itself is not here** — it's user-scoped; see
  [User-level config](#user-level-config).

---

## Guidelines files

Long-form, judgment-heavy rules don't belong in JSON. They live in markdown files named by
`guidelines.*` and are read by the skills as prose.

| File | Read by | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `coding.md` | `code-review`, `audit-architecture` | The coding standards a senior reviewer enforces here — error-handling conventions, logging (`logger` vs `print`/`console`), typing expectations, naming, banned patterns. |
| `testing.md` | `audit-tests`, `code-review` | Test conventions — the DB/fixture pattern, what may and may not be mocked, isolation rules, assertion expectations, naming. |
| `invariants.md` | `audit-architecture` | The **load-bearing, repo-specific invariants** that CI doesn't catch. This is the file that replaces the hardcoded repo-specific prose the old per-repo audits carried (e.g. pepper's `app.state` lifespan wiring + `SecretStr` rule; an Obsidian plugin's "use `plugin.logger`, never `console`" + "don't touch the generated-help file"). The audit reads each rule here and checks the diff against it. |
| `release.md` *(optional)* | `release` | Repo-specific release gates and caveats: a runtime/smoke test the unit suite can't cover, dependency caveats, release-name formatting a registry enforces, notes-rendering quirks, artifact specifics (e.g. an Obsidian plugin's live-transport smoke gate + the "release title must contain full X.Y.Z" rule). |

A skill that finds a guidelines file missing or still full of `TODO` markers should note that in
its report (the rule coverage is only as good as these files) and proceed with the
language-generic checks it can still perform.

---

## User-level config

Almost everything above is **repo-scoped** — it lives in each repo's `.claude/maintainerd.json`,
because it describes *that repo*. A few settings are **user-scoped**: they're the same across every
repo the user works in, so pinning them per-repo would be redundant and wrong. Those live in a
**user-level** file at `~/.claude/maintainerd.json`, read once regardless of which repo you're in.

Today this holds the `journal` category's vault:

```jsonc
// ~/.claude/maintainerd.json  (per-user, not checked into any repo)
{
  "journal": {
    "vault":        "/Users/you/Obsidian/my-vault", // Obsidian vault root — required by `worklog`
    "projectsGlob": "Projects/**"                    // where project folders live (optional; default "Projects/**")
  }
}
```

The split rule: **repo-scoped settings → repo config; user-scoped settings → user config.** `worklog`
bridges them — it reads the vault from here, and the *optional* per-repo `journal.project`/`hubNote`
pointer (above) from the repo config to know which vault project *this* repo maps to. If the user-level
file or `journal.vault` is absent, `worklog` asks for the vault path and offers to write it here.

A sample lives alongside this file as [`example-user.json`](example-user.json).

---

## Worked examples

A complete pepper (`python`) and obsidian-gemini (`typescript`) repo config live alongside this file
as [`example-pepper.json`](example-pepper.json) and [`example-obsidian.json`](example-obsidian.json),
and a user-level config as [`example-user.json`](example-user.json). They double as the round-trip
fixtures the verification step checks the schema against.
