# Obsidian work-log

Capture a day's accomplishments — from the day's **merged PRs** (the complete picture; work also
happens in cloud sessions, other terminals, and scheduled agents the live conversation can't see)
**enriched by the live session** (the *why* behind the slice it has context on) — and persist it to
the user's Obsidian vault in three places: a **session-summary note**, a **link from the project hub
note**, and a **one-line entry in the daily note**.

This is the first `journal`-category skill, and the first Maintainerd skill that is **user-scoped**
rather than repo-scoped: it writes to the user's personal vault, which is the same across every repo
they work in. So its core setting — the vault — lives in a **user-level** config, not per-repo.

## Append-safety (re-runs & multiple sessions) — READ FIRST

This is a hard requirement: the user runs Claude in **both the terminal and the desktop app**,
sometimes for the same project on the same day. The skill must **only ever add to** the daily note
and the project hub note — never replace, reorder, or drop existing content. Losing a prior entry is
the worst possible outcome.

Rules that make this safe:

1. **Targeted inserts only — never whole-file rewrites of existing notes.** For the daily note and
   the hub note, use `Edit` to insert your one new line/link by matching a stable nearby anchor (a
   heading like `## Notes`, the existing "Dev logs" section, or the last bullet there). **Do not use
   `Write` on a file that already exists** — `Write` replaces the whole file and is how prior entries
   get clobbered. `Write` is only for creating a brand-new file (a day's session note or a missing
   daily note).
2. **Read immediately before you edit.** Re-`Read` the daily note and hub note right before the
   `Edit`, not from a stale read earlier in the session — another session (app/terminal) may have
   written since. This shrinks the window where two runs could collide.
3. **One day's session note per project — extend it.** Before creating a session note, glob the
   project folder for an existing `Dev Log <today's date>*.md`. If one exists, **append** new items
   into its sections via `Edit` rather than creating a second note. Only `Write` a new note when none
   exists for today.
4. **De-dupe, don't double-up.** If the daily note already has a line for this project today, update
   that line in place instead of adding a second. If the hub already links today's note, don't add
   the link twice.
5. **Honest about the limit.** Targeted inserts + read-right-before-write make *sequential* runs
   (terminal now, app later) fully safe. Two *truly simultaneous* runs can still race, and Obsidian's
   own sync can create conflict copies if two devices edit at once. There's no file locking here; if
   you ever can't cleanly insert (anchor missing, content shifted unexpectedly), stop and tell the
   user rather than overwriting.

## Load config (two tiers)

worklog is user-scoped, so it reads two files — and, unlike repo-scoped skills, it does **not**
hard-stop if the repo-level config is missing.

1. **User-level `~/.claude/maintainerd.json`** — the required piece. Read `journal.vault` (the
   Obsidian vault root). See [`../../../core/reference/config-schema.md`](../../../core/reference/config-schema.md)
   ("User-level config"). If the file or `journal.vault` is absent, **ask the user for their vault
   path and offer to write it** to `~/.claude/maintainerd.json` so future runs are configured — don't
   hardcode a vault path. Optional keys: `journal.projectsGlob` (default `Projects/**`).
2. **Repo-level `.claude/maintainerd.json`** (optional for this skill) — if present, read `config.repo`
   (the GitHub slug for the PR scan) and the optional `config.journal` pointer that maps *this repo*
   to its vault project: `config.journal.project` (folder name under `Projects/**`) and/or
   `config.journal.hubNote` (explicit vault-relative hub-note path). If there's no repo config, fall
   back to `gh repo view` / the cwd folder name, and infer the project by matching that name under
   `journal.projectsGlob`.

## Inputs

Invoked as `/worklog [project-or-path]`. Interpret the argument:

- **A project name** → find its folder/hub note under `<vault>/<projectsGlob>`.
- **An absolute directory path** → treat it as the project folder; derive the vault as the nearest
  ancestor containing a `.obsidian/` directory (this can override `journal.vault`).
- **A vault path** (a dir containing `.obsidian/`) → use it as the vault and infer the project.
- **Empty** → infer the project from the current working directory (git repo / folder name), then
  resolve it under the configured vault.

If the project can't be resolved unambiguously, **ask** which project/folder before writing anything.
Never guess a target and write to the wrong place.

**Default behavior: blend both sources** (step 2) — the day's merged PRs for completeness, enriched
by the live session. Flags narrow that:

- `--no-prs` / `--session-only` → skip the PR scan; summarize just the live conversation.
- `--from-prs` (or "log what shipped today") → PRs only; don't draw on the live session (work happened
  elsewhere, e.g. a web session).
- A **date** (`YYYY-MM-DD`, "yesterday", "today") → the log date. Defaults to the current date.
- `--repo owner/name` → override the repo (otherwise from `config.repo`, `gh`, or the hub note).
- `--author @me` → only the user's own PRs (default: every PR merged that day, so parallel/automated
  work is captured too).

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve targets (read before writing)

- **Vault** — `journal.vault` (or an explicit path argument). Confirm it has a `.obsidian/` directory.
- **Daily-note location & format** — read `<vault>/.obsidian/daily-notes.json` (fall back to
  `periodic-notes.json`, then core defaults). Take `folder` and `format` (a moment.js date format,
  e.g. `YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD`) and a `template` if present. Build today's path from the **current date**
  in the environment context. Example: folder `Daily`, format `YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD`, date `2026-06-30`
  → `<vault>/Daily/2026/06/2026-06-30.md`.
- **Project folder + hub note** — use `config.journal.hubNote` if set; else `config.journal.project`
  (or the inferred repo name) to locate the folder under `journal.projectsGlob`. The hub note is the
  `.md` whose basename matches the folder, or the folder's most index-like note (a `* - MOC.md` /
  `<Project>.md`). Read it so you can add a link without clobbering existing content.

### 2. Gather the material, then summarize

By default **gather both** and blend: merged PRs are the source of truth for *what* shipped; the live
session adds the *why* for the slice it has context on.

**A. Scan the day's merged PRs** (skip only on `--no-prs`/`--session-only`):

1. **Resolve the repo**: `--repo`; else `config.repo`; else `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q
   .nameWithOwner`; else parse a `github.com/...` URL from the hub note's front-matter. If none
   resolves (or `gh` is unavailable), skip the PR scan, fall back to session-only, and say so.
2. **Fetch the day's merges** for the resolved date, timezone-aware so late-evening merges don't roll
   into the next UTC day:
   ```bash
   TZ_OFFSET=$(date +%z); TZF="${TZ_OFFSET:0:3}:${TZ_OFFSET:3}"
   gh pr list --repo <owner/name> --state merged --limit 200 \
     --search "merged:<DATE>T00:00:00${TZF}..<DATE>T23:59:59${TZF}" \
     --json number,title,url,mergedAt,labels,author,body
   ```
   Add `--author @me` only if requested. Zero PRs → say so and offer to widen the date or fall back to
   session-only; don't invent content.
3. **Read the PR bodies** for rationale/caveats/follow-ups — that's where decisions live. Cite each as
   `#<number>`. (If `daily-changelog` is in use, the per-day files under `config.paths.changelogDir`
   are an already-triaged shortcut.)

**B. Gather live-session context** (skip only on `--from-prs`): from this conversation, what was
actually done here and *why* — the decisions, dead ends, and gotchas that never make it into a PR body.

**C. Blend, keyed on PR number:** every merged PR appears in **Shipped**; for PRs this session worked
on (match by `#number`) use the richer session context; for PRs from elsewhere (cloud/other terminals,
automated/scheduled PRs) summarize from titles/bodies and keep routine ones brief. Note source limits
honestly (e.g. "PRs #X/#Y were done in a web session — detail is from their descriptions").

Write a tight, scannable summary — signal, not length:

```markdown
# Dev Log — <YYYY-MM-DD>: <short topic>

<one-sentence framing of the arc>

## Shipped
- <what landed, grouped logically; cite PRs/issues as #123 and link related notes>

## Decisions / gotchas worth remembering
- <non-obvious choices, root causes, "why", traps that cost time>

## Follow-ups
- [ ] <open threads, deferred work, things to verify — as checkboxes>

---
Related: [[<Project hub>]] · [[<other relevant notes>]]
```

Guidance: pull concrete identifiers (PR/issue numbers, file/area names, commands, decisions); prefer
"what changed and why it mattered" over a play-by-play. **Decisions/gotchas is the highest-value
section.** Follow-ups use GitHub-flavored `- [ ]` task syntax, never the Unicode ballot box. Use
`[[wikilinks]]` to the hub and related notes. Be honest about what's unverified or pending.

### 3. Write the three artifacts

Follow **Append-safety** for all of these — glob/Read first, `Edit` (insert) into existing files,
`Write` only to create a new file.

1. **Session-summary note** — first `Glob` `<ProjectFolder>/Dev Log <YYYY-MM-DD>*.md`.
   - **None today** → `Write` a new `<ProjectFolder>/Dev Log <YYYY-MM-DD> - <short topic>.md`.
   - **One exists** → `Read`, then `Edit` to append into the matching sections. Don't recreate it.
2. **Hub-note link** — `Read` the hub. Find a `Dev logs` / `Session logs` section (or add one just
   below the title/front-matter). If today's note is already linked, do nothing; else `Edit` to insert
   `- [[<note basename>]]`. Never `Write` the hub.
3. **Daily-note line** — compute the path from the daily-notes config + current date.
   - **Missing** → `Write` it from the configured `template` (fill date tokens for the current date),
     or a minimal note with the date heading and a `## Notes` section.
   - **Exists** → `Read`, then `Edit` to insert `- **<Project>**: <one-line summary> — [[<note
     basename>]]` into the notes section. If a line for this project + today is already there, update
     it in place instead of adding a second.

### 4. Report

Tell the user exactly what was written, with vault-relative paths: the new/updated session note, the
hub link, and the daily-note line (show that one-line entry verbatim so they can eyeball it). Don't
paste the whole session note back.

## Conventions

- **One session note per (project, day).** Re-running extends it (found by globbing `Dev Log <date>*`).
- **Never clobber.** `Edit`-insert into existing notes; reserve `Write` for brand-new files. Read
  right before editing. Preserve front-matter, headings, and existing bullets.
- **Match the vault's voice.** Mirror heading levels, bullet vs. checkbox usage, and wikilink style
  already present in the project's notes.
- **Vault-relative wikilinks** use the note basename (Obsidian resolves them), not absolute paths.
- **Dates** come from the environment's current date; format the daily-note path per the vault's
  daily-notes config, not a guessed convention.

## Edge cases

- **No `journal.vault` configured** — ask for the vault path and offer to write it to the user-level
  config; don't hardcode one.
- **No daily-notes config / unusual format** — fall back to `<vault>/Daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`; mention
  the assumption in the report.
- **No hub note** — if the project folder has no obvious hub `.md`, create a minimal one
  (`# <Project>` + a `Dev logs` section) or ask; don't silently skip the link.
- **Multiple vaults / ambiguous project** — ask rather than guess.
- **Thin session** — if little of substance happened, say so and write a short note (or ask whether to
  skip) instead of padding.
- **Sensitive content** — don't write secrets, tokens, or credentials into the vault even if they
  appeared in the session; summarize around them.
